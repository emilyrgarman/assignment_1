    "You could create prediction tools to answer the questions about the most common bottle volumes purchased based on the kind of liquor. Liquor stores and producers/marketers of the alcohol may be interested in these predictions so that they can produce a higher quantity of liquor in a more desired bottle volume rather than over-producing bottle volumes that are not purchased as often. This could save these stakeholders money down the line. Making these kinds of predictions raises questions about the privacy of the buyer. Should liqor stores and mass-producers be able to track the sales of liqor in this way? Does this enable these stakeholders to market their products in harmful ways to at-risk buyers through targeted advertising and price manipulation? I would also be interested in seeing the time of purchase and if the date of purchase was on a weekend/weekday, rather than just the date. Though perhaps not entirely ethical, this would help me to promote my product more effectively if I see patterns of purchase."
